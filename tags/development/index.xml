      <description>torproxy I am using Tor for quite a while now and it got really fast over the years. Meanwhile there are several options to run traffic through Tor and one of them is using a &amp;ldquo;dockerized&amp;rdquo; container. The most used image is probably the one from this repository: torproxy-by-dperson. And to run all traffic through this docker it was necessary to do some iptables, but luckily there was also a shell script given.</description>
