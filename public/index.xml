      <description>torproxy I am using Tor for quite a while now and it got really fast over the years. Meanwhile there are several options to run traffic through Tor and one of them is using a &amp;ldquo;dockerized&amp;rdquo; container. The most used image is probably the one from this repository: torproxy-by-dperson. And to run all traffic through this docker it was necessary to do some iptables, but luckily there was also a shell script given.</description>

      <description>Developing an automatic plant irrigation system I was working with an Arduino the last few weeks and never did before. But not only an Arduino, the Arduino was cooperating with an circuit and communicating with a Raspberry Pi.
Actually, it was pretty fun. But there were some problems for which I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a solution for. E.g. Arduino IDE not pushing the code with the following error message:
avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding.</description>
