      <description>I was working with an Arduino the last few weeks and never did before. But not only an Arduino, the Arduino was cooperating with an circuit and communicating with a Raspberry Pi.
Actually, it was pretty fun. But there were some problems for which I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a solution for. E.g. Arduino IDE not pushing the code with the following error message:
avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding. There were some posts on the Internet like StackOverflow, but those weren&amp;rsquo;t the solutions.</description>
